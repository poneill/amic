"""

The purpose of this script is:

    (1) to determine a common interface for TF-DNA lattice models, and
    (2) to provide benchmarks for different sampling algorithms.

The fundamental inputs to the model are:
    (1) A DNA sequence, which may be either circular or linear
    (2) A Hamiltonian that indirectly determines the probability of the system occupying any particular configuration.
